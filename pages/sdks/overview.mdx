# Overview
A documented page on the installation & setup need to get Datalink up & running.

## Get Started
To begin on your Datalink adventure, we need to account for the following;

- You have a registered Datalink Account & Experience
- You have the Datalink LuaU SDK installed & setup in your Experience

## Installation
> Prebuilt Datalink Binary

Grab the latest version of the SDK from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/datalinkhq/rbx-datalink/releases/) and import the binary into your Roblox Studio

> Compilation of Datalink Binary

Datalink can be compiled from it's source, however this may also yield errors/changes which have not yet been accounted for.

<Code>
```bash
# Clone the RBX-Datalink Repository
git clone https://github.com/datalinkhq/rbx-datalink.git

# Move your active directory into the cloned datalink folder
cd rbx-datalink

# Use rojo to compile the Datalink Binary
rojo build -o sdk.rbxm

# You can then import this Datalink Binary into your game.
```
</Code>

For our beloved TypeScript developers:

<Code>
```bash
# We use pnpm in this example, but the same can be applied to your package manager.
# Clone the RBX-Datalink Repository
git clone https://github.com/datalinkhq/rbx-datalink.git

# Move your active directory into the cloned datalink folder
cd rbx-datalink

# Install Node.JS dependencies
pnpm i

# Compile the TypeScript code the roblox-ts compiler
pnpm run build

# Build the compiled TypeScript code using rojo:
rojo build ts.project.json -o sdk.rbxm

# You can then import this Datalink Binary into your game.
```
</Code>

--------------------------

> Wally (or a TypeScript) Package Manager

Datalink can be installed using [wally](https://wally.run), a modern, cargo-style package manager for ROBLOX. 
That said, we also support NPM, PNPM & Yarm for those who use TypeScript in their projects.

<Code>
```toml
# The following entry can be added to your Wally TOML 
# to install Datalink into your LuaU Project

rbx-datalink = "datalinkhq/rbx-datalink@2.0.1"
```

```bash
# The following commands can be executed to install
# Datalink into your TypeScript project

# NPM
npm i @datalinkhq/rbx-datalink

# PNPM
pnpm i @datalinkhq/rbx-datalink

# Yarn
yarn add @datalinkhq/rbx-datalink
```
</Code>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
	The LuaU files can still be called from TypeScript when installed using Wally
