# Server-side JS SDK
The Hop server-side JS SDK allows you to interact with all Hop products on the server side.

## Installing

### npm
```bash
npm i @onehop/js
```

### yarn
```
yarn add @onehop/js
```


## Creating an SDK Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a [project token](/reference/project_tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your projects.

<Code>
```js
import { Hop } from '@onehop/js';

const myToken = 'ptk_xxx';
const hop = new Hop(myToken);

// Example: Creating a project secret
hop.projects.secrets.create(
	'RANDOM_NUMBER',
	Math.floor(Math.random() * 100).toString(),
);
```
</Code>
