# Authentication

Before the Datalink SDK can start reporting your game analytics, it has to be configured & authenticated properly. 

Grab an API key from the Datalink Dashboard, and use example code below. 

<Callout type="error" emoji="â€¼">
  Make sure you do not leak your API Key, as it would give an attacker **FULL ACCESS**  to your data.
</Callout>

<Code>
```lua
local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")

local DatalinkService = require(ServerStorage.DatalinkService)

DatalinkService:Initialize(userId: number, key: string)
```
</Code>


<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  A recommended method to safeguard your API Key is to store it in a private and secure `DataStore`.
</Callout>
