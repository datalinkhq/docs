# Authentication

Once the Datalink Instance is set up, you can then authenticate yourself to get started with using what the service has to offer;

<Code>
```lua
local DatalinkModule = require(Path.To.Module)
local Datalink = DatalinkModule.new({
	datalinkUserAccountId = 0,
	datalinkUserToken = ""
})

Datalink:authenticateAsync():andThen(function()
  print'Datalink Authenticated!'
end):catch(warn)

```
```typescript

```
</Code>


<Callout type="error" emoji="">
  Please ensure that the Authentication Key is **NOT** exposed to the client as this would provide an attacker **full, unrestricted** access to your experience's data.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  A recommended method to safeguard your API Key is to store it in a private and secure `DataStore`.
