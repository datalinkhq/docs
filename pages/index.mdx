# Datalink
Datalink is a tool that helps to provide Roblox Developers with critical & detailed analysis surrounding both Player & Game state & data in a Roblox Experience

## Product Summary
Datalink should provide a suite of interfaces which help to destinguish and expose information regarding state, health, mobility, player data & more:

- Game/Experience State
	- State is defined by the contextual agreement surrounding a servers ability to perform, allow users to join, remove and update datastores. 
	- For example, The State field could include;
		- Servers Per `Hour`, `Day`, `Month`, `Annum`
<br> </br>
- Game/Experience Health
	- Health is defined by how much CPU, Memory, Processing Time is being taken up by the server.
	- Additionally, we can look further and provide feedback regarding player crashing rates, reproduction steps on how these players might of crashed and potential fixes if any are obvious
<br> </br>
- Data
	- Data includes all kinds of information regading the places inside of your Roblox Experience
	- Custom Developer Events will also be counted under this field, as we are unable to process specifics in your events.
<br> </br>
- So, so much more!
	- We're still yet and looking into providing so much more which'll help improve the scalability of your experience!
	- Some examples of what we're planning to Ship Datalink with are;
		- Fast/Feature Flags
		- DataStore, MemoryStore & MessagingService wrappers
		- Game Event Controllers
		- Live information flow

With the above in mind, we would also love to hear your feedback and what you have to say!
