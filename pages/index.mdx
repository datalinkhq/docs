# Datalink
Datalink was built to provide a interface to analyze anonymous game analytics collected through Roblox experiences.

## Product Summary
Datalink is a series of applications which provide critical information regarding the state, health and mobility of your Roblox experiences.

Unlike traditional game analytics Datalink strives to provide feedback on not just your player base, game economics and so forth, but also integrates the usage of other services to make your life as a developer easier.

At Datalink, we are planning to support the following;
- Live Experience Information & Trackers
- Support for Roblox Fast/Feature Flags
- DataStore & MemoryStore Explorer
- MessagingService Controller & Manipulator

## Getting Started
> Lua SDK

The [Lua SDK](https://github.com/) is a Datalink RESTful API wrapper, the Lua SDK provides a minimal & efficient way to interface with the Datalink Service. 

> RESTful APIs

The [RESTful API](https://github.com/) is the backend to the Datalink service, if you've chosen to write your own wrapper/module for the Datalink service, then taking advantage of these APIs will be of interest.
